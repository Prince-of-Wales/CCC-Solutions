# CCC Solutions

Unofficial, community-driven solutions to the [Canadian Computing Competition](https://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html). Most solutions are copied from this [Milliken Mills CCC repository](http://mmhs.ca/ccc/index.htm).

##Contributors
The largest contributor to this repository is Mr. Robart, formerly of Milliken Mills high school, who wrote the vast majority of the programs. All other contributors should be listed in the files that they helped to author.

##Contribute
If you have a solution to contribute, submit a pull request! In order for your pull request to be accepted, make sure the filename follows the general conventions set out by the other files. That is, if you're submitting a solution to S5 2016 in Java, you should be submitting the file to `2016->Senior`, and your file should be named `S5.java`. While this won't work with the online grader, it avoids the ambiguity of having multiple files named `Main.java`.
