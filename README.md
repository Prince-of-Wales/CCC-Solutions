##Contribute
If you have a solution to contribute, submit a pull request! In order for your pull request to be accepted, make sure the filename follows the general conventions set out by the other files. That is, if you're submitting a solution to S5 2016 in Java, you should be submitting the file to `2016->Senior`, and your file should be named `S5.java`. While this won't work with the online grader, it avoids the ambiguity of having multiple files named `Main.java`.
